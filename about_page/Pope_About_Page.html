            Ryan Smith is from San Diego, California, and studied software engineering at Western Governors University and has a nano degree through Udacity. He acquired an internship with AT&T as a software developer. At the end of the six-month internship, he received a full-time offer as a software engineer with AT&T in Los Angeles, California. In California, he met Kody Pope, who was working towards a bachelor's degree in acting at the American Musical Dramatic Academy College and Conservatory of the Performing Arts in Hollywood, California. The two fell in love. After being together for three years, they moved in together on Valentine's Day. Together, the two of them got their third family member, a Yorkshire Terrier named Pepsi, who is a jealous little brat.
Ryan enjoys escape rooms, where you are locked in a room, although not actually locked in, and you solve a series of games, puzzles, or challenges to get out of the game. All must be done typically within one hour. You beat the game and escape if you leave the room within one hour. If the timer runs out before you can get out, you lose. However, part of the fun is that people watch you on a computer screen through cameras stationed throughout the room. They are there to help guide you on your quest to get out of the room. Part of the fun is never asking for help; they are there if needed. Also, depending on how challenging the room is, part of the fun is that you usually get a set number of questions to ask that do not count against your score. Typically, it is three questions. If you must ask more than three questions to get out within the hour, technically, you did not beat the room.
Ryan also really enjoys Korean barbecue. This is typically when you sit at a table with a grill in the center of the table, and raw meat is given to you to cook at your desired doneness. One of his favorite meats to cook is spicy pork bulgogi, thinly sliced pork seasoned with various spices to give it a juicy little kick.
Growing up and even to this day, Ryan's absolute favorite band is ABBA. If you were to ask him to sing a karaoke song or go out of karaoke with him, he would surely pick any song, and I do mean any song, from ABBA. Ryan also enjoys podcasts. One of his favorite podcasts is the No Sleep podcast, a series of stories that are typically horror fiction and self-contained within the podcast, meaning one podcast is one horror story, and the second would be an unrelated, horror-themed story.
To match this typical horror theme, his favorite TV and film genre is horror or something unorthodox, like his favorite TV show, A Series of Unfortunate Events. The show follows three children who go on a journey and adventure together where these awful or rather unfortunate events continuously happen to these children. It is not a comedy, but the show does bring a good laugh.
Pope 1 of 13
Again, following this theme, his favorite book, without a doubt, is Harry Potter. Specifically, The Order of the Phoenix and his favorite part of The Order of the Phoenix is when the children break into the Department of Mysteries to rescue Serius Black. A seriously eventful moment that leads to one of the children even performing an enormously powerful spell that does something grand, but I do not want to spoil it, so I will leave it at that.
