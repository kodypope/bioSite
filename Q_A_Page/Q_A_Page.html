                How do you spend your free time?
            </p>
            <p>
                I spend my free time playing video games and exploring the city I moved to. Going to escape rooms. And
                hang out with my dog. <br><br><br>
            </p>
            <p id="quest">
                What is your favorite food?
            </p>
            <p>
                Korean BBQ, I specifically like spicy pork bulgogi. It is savory, salty pork, thinly sliced, that you grill on a
                grill in the center of your table. It has a slight heat to it. <br><br><br>

                Do you listen to any podcasts?
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, I listen to the <a href="https://www.thenosleeppodcast.com">THE NOSLEEP PODCAST</a>. <br><br><br>
            </p>
            <p id="quest">
                Have you heard of [movie or TV show you enjoy]?
            </p>
            <p>
                A Series of Unfortunate Events. It is a TV show about three children who need to escape Count Olaf, who
                wants to steal their fortune. <br><br><br>

                What is your favorite thing to do on the weekend?
            </p>
            <p>
                Go to a fun restaurant or new restaurant and then do a fun activity like an escape room. <br><br><br>
            </p>
            <p id="quest">
                Do you have any pets?
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, a Yorkie named Pepsi. He is genuinely sassy. My favorite moment is when Kody got a Covid shot and
                needed to lie down. Of course, Kody lay on the opposite arm, from which he got his shot. Pepsi
                wanted to play with Kody, but Kody just wanted to rest because he was feeling unwell from Covid
                shot, so Pepsi got up on the back of the sofa, went right above Kody's arm, and then jumped right on
                Kody's arm was exactly where Kody had gotten his shot. <br><br><br>
