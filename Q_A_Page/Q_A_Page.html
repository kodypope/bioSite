                Interview: <br><br>
How do you spend your free time? <br>
I spend my free time playing video games and exploring the city I moved to. Going to escape rooms. And
hang out with my dog. <br><br><br>
What is your favorite food? <br>
Korean BBQ, I specifically like spicy pork bulgogi. It is savory, salty pork, thinly sliced, that you grill on a
grill in the center of your table. It has a slight heat to it. <br><br><br>
Do you listen to any podcasts? <br>
Yes, I listen to the No Sleep podcast. (Add Link Here!!!) <br><br><br>
Have you heard of [movie or TV show you enjoy]? <br>
A Series of Unfortunate Events. It is a TV show about three children who need to escape Count Olaf, who
wants to steal their fortune. <br><br><br>
What is your favorite thing to do on the weekend? <br>
Go to a fun restaurant or new restaurant and then do a fun activity like an escape room. <br><br><br>
Do you have any pets? <br>
Yes, a Yorkie named Pepsi. He is genuinely sassy. My favorite moment is when Kody got a Covid shot and
needed to lie down. Of course, Kody lay on the opposite arm, from which he got his shot. Pepsi
wanted to play with Kody, but Kody just wanted to rest because he was feeling unwell from Covid
shot, so Pepsi got up on the back of the sofa, went right above Kody's arm, and then jumped right on
Kody's arm was exactly where Kody had gotten his shot. <br><br><br>
Do you have a favorite book? <br>
Harry potter. My favorite on-order is the Phenix. My favorite moment from the book is the Department of
mysteries. <br><br><br>
What is your favorite place to eat around [neighborhood]? <br>
Kura revolving sushi. I always go for shrimp nigiri. <br><br><br>
What would you choose if you had to choose one meal for the rest of your life? <br>
Pizza. My favorite topping is pepperoni. <br><br><br>
What is your go-to karaoke song? <br>
Anything from ABBA. <br>
